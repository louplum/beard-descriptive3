# beard-descriptive3: "Cariban Kinship Tendencies"
Description of final project dataset with accompanying example of Panare collateral kinship terms.

I have compiled a dataset of tendencies for several Cariban languages toward the roughly six known kinship system prototypes (Morgan, 1871). The languages and their associated Glottocodes are below:

Ikpeng: ikpe1245
Katawian: kata1269
Panare: enap1235
Pará_Arára: para1310
Trío: trio1238
Waiwai: waiw1244

My dataset utilizes the parameter legend from the work “Nota Sobre O Sistema de Parentesco Em Proto-Tupí-Guaraní” (Birchall et. al). The original Portuguese prose is roughly translated below:

"Typological characterizations of the languages under investigation, based on the following parameters: A = maternal fusion +1; B = paternal fusion +1; C = Maternal Bifurcation +1; D = Avuncular Bifurcation +1; E = equation between brothers and parallel cousins; F = Equation between brothers and cousins; G = ego sex distinction +0; H = relative age +0, same sex; I = relative age +0, opposite sex."

My dataset assigns the above parameters (columns B to J) with Boolean values TRUE or FALSE instead of numerical values. NA signals unknowns, where no applicable data could be found from my sources.

The genealogy tree added is an example of one language I sourced for the dataset; namely, Panare (Glottocode enap1235) collateral kinship terms via the female ego, sourced from Kinbank.net. The parameter "no distinction between ego sex" shows here TRUE for all non-nuclear terms inside the same generation. This is known as "Hawaiianization" of the kinship system of this particular language.
